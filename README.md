# MFML

This repository contains the notebooks I completed whilst following Imperial College's [*Mathematics for Machine Learning* coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning).

*FWIW - you get a certificate of completion from the Imperial course, mine is [here](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/ARMLMTNPZJTD)*

## Notebooks

Disclaimer - I did not *create* these notebooks in this section, though I did *complete* them - they are provided by Coursera for completion as part of the assessement material for this course.
